## Pull requests - Workflow

If you have code or documentation changes you would like to submit as a pull request, please 

* Fork the repository
* Make changes either directly in the forked devel branch or create a new branch for the changes you would like to submit for review
* Validate your code and run the existing unit tests using `Invoke-Pester` to ensure you have not introduced any breaking changes
* Create a Pull Request (PR) and fill out the template, then submit the Pull Request for review

From this point onwards, your changes will be validated and in the pull request additional code might be pushed or code changes can be suggested. Make sure that you monitor your notifications.
